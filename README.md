# VNExtendedSTM32
Version of VibraNavigation project developed for STM32L432KC NUCLEO. My first steps with this equipment, so it could be a little messy. Issues for now - communication with NEO-6M (GPS) via UART, communication with HC-SR04 (ultrasonic ranging module) via timer, communication with HMC5883L (magnetometer - electronic compass) via I^2C
